To write a git extension some conditions must be satisfied:

    1) the name must be git-[EXTENSION]
    2) the file has to be in the PATH
    3) the file has to be executable
    
Once done you can simply type "git [EXTENSION]" and it will be executed.
It does not really matter if the file is a bash, ruby or python script.
